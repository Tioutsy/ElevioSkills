  fullDescription:
    "This course covers simple habits and practical systems that lower environmental impact through correct waste separation and recycling. Tailored specifically for Mauritian workplaces, it highlights local island constraints—such as Mare Chicose landfill limits—and explains why you must always follow workplace bin labels rather than assuming a single universal national color scheme.",
